# Wind load

In construction stage, wind load is an important factor affecting the stability of the prefabricated rebar cage.

The location of the construction site will affect the wind velocity. So, the 1st step to get the base velocity is to find the map.

Based on the map, Vb,map will be obtained. Then multiply to the coefficient for height above sea level.

For example: On map, velocity V0,map = 20 m/s. The location of site is 20 m above sea. 

Vb,0 = 20 x (1 + 0.001 x 20) = 20.4 m/s

Of course, the wind speed is defined based on the map().
